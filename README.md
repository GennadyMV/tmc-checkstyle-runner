This is a stand-alone Java-software for running Checkstyle validations on Java-code. It’s developed as an extension for [TMC](https://github.com/testmycode/), but also works separately. The extension is used in the [tmc-netbeans](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-netbeans/) and [tmc-server](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-server/) projects.

## Build

Build the project with `mvn clean package`. Install the dependency to your local Maven repository with `mvn clean install`.

## Test

Test the project with `mvn test`.

## Usage

Add the dependency to your project’s `pom.xml`.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>fi.helsinki.cs.tmc</groupId>
    <artifactId>tmc-checkstyle-runner</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

Running Checkstyle validations can be accomplished programmatically or from the command line.

### Programmatically

Create a `CheckstyleRunner` and pass the project directory as a file to the constructor. Running will return a `CheckstyleResult`.

```java
File projectDirectory = new File("path/to/project-directory/");
CheckstyleRunner runner = new CheckstyleRunner(projectDirectory);
CheckstyleResult result = runner.run();
```

### CLI

Running Checkstyle validations from the command line can be accomplished by passing the project directory and output file paths as properties. The output file will contain the `CheckstyleResult` serialised as JSON.

```bash
java -Dtmc.project_dir=[PROJECT-DIRECTORY-PATH] -Dtmc.validations_file=[OUTPUT-FILE-PATH] -jar tmc-checkstyle-runner-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Configuration

Running Checkstyle validations works as is with default settings. No configuration is needed. However, you can configure the runner by creating a `tmc.json`-configuration file to the root of the project to be tested.

```json
{
    "checkstyle": {
        "enabled": false,
        "rule": "mooc-checkstyle.xml"
	}
}
```

* `enabled` — whether running Checkstyle validations is enabled, true by default.
* `rule` — the name of a custom [Checkstyle-configuration](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config.html) file. Should be in the root of the project. See [default-checkstyle.xml](src/main/resources/default-checkstyle.xml) for the default configuration.
